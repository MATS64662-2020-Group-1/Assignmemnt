# Research Software Engineering Practice 2019-2020

This is the repository for the Research Software Engineering Practice module of the AMS CDT. 

## Aim of the Unit and of the Assignment

The aim of this course is to learn about modern software engineering practice, particularly to learn about Python, version control and collaborating on code development using the GitHub workflow.

As a group, a program to perform image-based physics (diffusion, thermal conduction, solid mechanics etc.) simulations should be developed using:

- Available open-source FE and image-analysis packages
- Microstructure images from your research work, scientific literature and/or the provided image database

This is an application of what has been covered in your Python and Git tutorials. The work should include documentation, examples and test cases with any further desired functionality added.

## First Task: Image Analysis

Assigned to: Joshua Collins

This task involves obtaining microstructural images from research work, scientific literature and/or the provided image database. It is important that full permission is acquired when using the images to avoid any copyright issues. The images will be pre-processed accordingly so they can be imported into an FE simulation e.g. through segmentation, mesh generation, removing speckle noise.
